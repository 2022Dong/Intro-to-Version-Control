# Remotely Useful

So we have the basics of using Git, but at the moment all our versioned code is stuck on the local machine. That's not very safe.

A way that we can get around this is to use a Version Control Repository that is hosted in the cloud, or as it is known by most, a Remote.

A Remote is a copy of Git running on a server somewhere else, usually with a GUI front end, most commonly a Web-based interface.
