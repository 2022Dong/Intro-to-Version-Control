# Remotely Useful

So we have the basics of using Git, but at the moment all our versioned code is stuck on the local machine. That's not very safe.

A way that we can get around this is to use a Version Control Repository that is hosted in the cloud, or as it is known by most, a Remote.

A Remote is a copy of Git running on a server somewhere else, usually with a GUI front end, most commonly a Web-based interface.

There are many repository management systems run both for free and profit. It is also possible to create a self hosted web based repository management system.

Common (and less common) systems include:
- GitHub
- GitLab
- BitBucket
- Gitea
- GNU Savannah
- GitBucket
- Gogs

# GitHub

## Creating a GitHub account

Go to https://github.com/join and on the sign-up page enter your details.

When doing this, there are a couple of items to note:
- The username needs to be unique.
- You cannot reuse an email address.
- You may use a personal email address or your TAFE student email.
- Do NOT make the username offensive, as many prospective employers will look at your accounts!

The next step requires you to verify that you are not a bot by solving a puzzle.

Once the puzzle is solved, you will then need to verify your email address.

To do this GitHub will send you and email that contains a link. Opening this link will verify your email address.

Once you have verified your email address, you are all done and are now able to create your very first project on GitHub.
