# Forking Over Code

So far we have gone through and practiced the concepts of:
- creating a local repository, 
- adding & updating files in the staging area, 
- committing files to the repository, 
- creating a remote repository, 
- attaching the local to the remote, 
- pushing files to the remote,
- pulling files from the remote, and
- cloning an existing repository to our local machine.

Cloning is one way to work with a repository, but when you are working on an established, and predominately open source, project, the use of a "fork" provides more control, especially for the owner(s) of the repository.

# GitHub and Forking

The concept of a fork is a GitHub feature. It basically clones the repository to another location on GitHub.

In return, GitHub maintains a link back to the original to allow collaboration on the project/repository.

## How to Fork

Forking is done within the GitHub Web GUI.

The basic process is:
- Find the repository you wish to fork
- Read the ReadMe and any documentation on how to fork and contribute to the repository
- Fork the repository (to your account)
- Clone the repository to your local device
