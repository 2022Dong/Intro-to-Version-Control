# Forking Over Code

So far we have gone through and practiced the concepts of:

- creating a local repository,
- adding & updating files in the staging area,
- committing files to the repository,
- creating a remote repository,
- attaching the local to the remote,
- pushing files to the remote,
- pulling files from the remote, and
- cloning an existing repository to our local machine.

Cloning is one way to work with a repository, but when you are working on an established, and predominately open source,
project, the use of a "fork" provides more control, especially for the owner(s) of the repository.

# GitHub and Forking

The concept of a fork is a GitHub feature. It basically clones the repository to another location on GitHub.

In return, GitHub maintains a link back to the original to allow collaboration on the project/repository.

## Why Fork

There are two main reasons:
1. Go your own way
2. Contribute

### Go your own way

This type of fork allows you freedom to take the project in a totally new direction.

It allows you to experiment, learn and grow.

It provides you with the opportunity to develop a new application or system based on the original, and then the ability to not look back!

Another part of this is that you still get the original project's updated code, bug fixes etc to be merged into your code at your discretion.

This type of fork gives you complete control of your project.

### Contribute

In the contribution type of fork, you are using the fork almost like a branch. 

The big thing about this is that you only need read permissions to the original repo to start working.

## Forking in the Enterprise

Remember that forking is a GitHub feature. Other Git hosting solutions may have similar features.

Forking is common practice in open source development.


## Comparing Forks v Branches


|                                           | Forks                                                                                  | Branches                                                              |
| ----------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Purpose**                               | Create a separate copy of a repository for significant changes or different directions | Develop new features or fix bugs without disrupting the main codebase |
| **Relationship to the original codebase** | Completely independent repository                                                      | Linked to the original repository                                     |
| **Ownership**                             | Owned by the user who created them                                                     | Owned by the repository owner                                         |
| **Scope of changes**                      | Typically involve significant changes                                                  | Typically involve smaller changes                                     |
| **Collaboration**                         | Used to develop ideas in isolation from the main team                                  | Used to develop ideas that the main team is working on                |

## How to Fork

Forking is done within the GitHub Web GUI.

The basic process is:

- Find the repository you wish to fork
- Read the ReadMe and any documentation on how to fork and contribute to the repository
- Fork the repository (to your account)
- Clone the repository to your local device
