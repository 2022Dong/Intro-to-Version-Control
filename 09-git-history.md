## History so Far...

To see the history of the project so far we use...
```bash
git log
```
![[pasted-image-20240216123842.png]]

> **Note:** The history is shown in reverse order... newest first.

This is very lengthy, and most of the time we can work with a short version of the log. To get this we use:

```shell
git log --oneline
```

Which produces a shorthand version of the log:

What is important is that the message shows in this log. It is a good idea *not* to have a very long first line to a commit message.
